This project defines a Web page with an interface to create repeating
countdown timers.

INSTALLATION

After the project is downloaded, navigating to index.html will allow
the page to be used. To install to a remote server, the variables in
the Makefile should be filled in, and
	 $ make publish
should be executed.

New sounds can be added by putting them in the project directory, and
adding them to the <select> tag in index.html.

USAGE

index.html renders a very plain Web page. Once popups are enabled,
clicking on one of the "Default times" links will create a window with
a countdown timer. The window will have a blank text field underneath
the numbers, to allow the timer to be labeled.

When a timer reaches 0, it will play the sound most recently chosen on
the main page before it was created, and then restart.

The "URL of sound file" field can use one of the drop-down box's
options, or can include a complete URL beginning with http://

Finally, if anything is put in the "Specific numbers of minutes"
field, then it is assumed to be a comma-separated list of
minutes. The timer created will count down for the first number,
followed by the second, and so on until it repeats on the final number
given.
